# email-ba
My practice recreation of an html/css email. Project available  at https://lagesh.github.io/email-ba/ .
This is a marketing email received by me from British Airways and I have only just recreated it as part of my practice of html emails. All content - images and words -  are copyright of British Airways, except the lorem ipsum part at the footer. I have also not inlcuded the full links for some anchors because they contain sensitive personal information.
